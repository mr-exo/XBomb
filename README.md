An E-Mail Bomber made in Python.\
I'm rewriting this file since the explanation of this script is dogshit.\
There's a v2 coming soon aswell.\
To download XBomb, paste this command:\
`git clone https://github.com/mr-exo/XBomb.git`
Then, do:\
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
And finally, run the script with:\
`py XBomb.py`
`python3 XBomb.py`
