# XBomb
An E-Mail Bomber made in Python.

I'm rewriting this file since the explanation of this script is dogshit.

There's a v2 coming soon aswell.

To download XBomb, paste this command:\
`git clone https://github.com/mr-exo/XBomb.git`

Then, do:\
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

And finally, run the script with:\
`python3 XBomb.py`
